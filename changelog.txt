= 4.0.4 =
* Fixed shortcode: `searchform` shortcode didn't work properly.
* Setting post type or post content weight to 0 didn't work.
* Gravity Forms shortcode is now disabled in Relevanssi indexing.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt_query` filters the search query before building excerpts.
* HTML tags are stripped from post excerpts when using the excerpt to build Relevanssi excerpts.
* Fixed filter: `relevanssi_custom_field_value` didn't have the correct post ID parameter.
* `relevanssi_get_permalink` doesn't add the `highlight` parameter to URLs outside search results pages anymore, and won't add the parameter to front page links either.
* Relevanssi used `sanitize_hex_color`, which isn't actually reliably available.
* Did you mean suggestions have been improved.
* Single-word phrases are not allowed anymore, as they do no good. They are silently converted to non-phrases now.

= 4.0.3 =
* Relevanssi didn't index all posts with one go. It does now.
* © and ® symbols caused problems in indexing; they are now included in the default punctuation removal.
* In some cases excerpt-building could take ages because of autoembed link discovery. Relevanssi now blocks the autoembed procedure in link-building.
* New filter: `relevanssi_custom_field_value` is used to filter custom field values both before indexing and before excerpt-building. Parameters include the field name and the post ID.
* Updated filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` now gets a second parameter that contains the post ID.

= 4.0.2 =
* Removed couple of error notices in the code.
* Improved the support for page builders.
* Improvements to the Polylang setting.

= 4.0.1 =
* The plugin can now be uninstalled.

= 4.0 =
* Legacy code has been removed. If you have a version older than 3.6, update first to 3.6.2.2 to guarantee smooth upgrade process.
* Improved indexing: no more clicking "Continue indexing" again and again!
* Settings pages have been completely rewritten.
* There's documentation in the WordPress contextual help: just click Help on the top right corner.
* Better Polylang support. A new option to remove the Polylang language filter.
* Logs can be automatically trimmed. Old log entries are removed to save space.
* Finally a setting to adjust content weight!
* Excerpts can use the custom field content.
* Highlighting in documents is changed: it now requires a `highlight` query parameter. This helps getting pass caching and makes the highlighting more reliable. To get the query parameter active, use `relevanssi_get_permalink()` to print out the permalinks on the search results templates.
* Relevanssi added synonyms to highlighting even if synonyms were not used for searching. In some cases, synonyms were added twice.
* The User Searches page got a makeover, too.
* Relevanssi is automatically disabled in REST API searches.
* Groups and Simple Membership support has been improved.
* Sorting search results is now up to 300 times faster than before.
* Lots of improvements all over the place.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt_custom_field_content` lets you modify custom field content that is used for excerpts.
* New filter: `relevanssi_punctuation_filter` allows for easy modification of punctuation handling.
* New filter: `relevanssi_default_punctuation_replacement` changes the default way to handle the rest of the punctuation.
* New filter: `relevanssi_search_again` lets you run the search again if no results are found and to modify the parameters between search runs.
* New filter: `relevanssi_fallback` allows you to do fallback searches.
* New filter: `relevanssi_page_builder_shortcodes` lets you control which page builder shortcodes Relevanssi removes before building the excerpts.
* New filter: `relevanssi_optimize_excerpts` makes excerpt-building faster, if you make the filter return `true`.

= 3.6.2.2 =
* A bug in post sorting broke string sorting (mostly post title sorting).

= 3.6.2.1 =
* A bug was left in the post ordering code. That bug is now squashed.

= 3.6.2 =
* Simple Membership plugin is now supported automatically to restrict access to posts.
* Relevanssi can now handle orderby parameter in array format.
* Relevanssi now blocks Easy Digital Downloads shortcodes when indexing to improve compatibility with EDD.
* When using `fields` to only fetch post IDs, Relevanssi doesn't try to highlight post titles.
* New action: `relevanssi_update_options` lets you adjust Relevanssi options immediately after the defaults are set.
* Remove notices about duplicated database columns when installing the plugin.

= 3.6.1 =
* SECURITY: This version fixes a SQL injection vulnerability, where a site admin could theoretically inject SQL code into Relevanssi search queries. Doing this required access to Relevanssi settings page and in my tests, I couldn't do any damage, just break the Relevanssi search, but in any case, this vulnerability is now fixed.
* Search and Filter shortcode is added to the blacklist.
* Groups plugin is now supported automatically to restrict access to posts.
* The filter `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` now works even if the custom field setting is empty.
* The filter `relevanssi_post_to_index` now has a second parameter. For posts, it simply repeats the post object, but for taxonomy terms, it has the term object.

= 3.6.0 =
* Changed a bit how Relevanssi attaches itself to queries. Instead of the global $wp_query, Relevanssi now uses the query passed as the parameter to `the_posts` filter hook. This should improve compatibility in some cases, but may cause problems in some fringe cases. If you're doing something unusual with Relevanssi, try this out before deploying to public use.
* Some meta queries caused major problems with the Relevanssi weighting algorithm. This has now been fixed.
* Error notices caused by trying to use a non-existing taxonomy term have been removed.

= 3.5.12 =
* Post type exclusion didn't work as expected.
* Relevanssi couldn't handle nested tax queries (such as those generated by WooCommerce product visibility filtering) properly.

= 3.5.11.1 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_allow_one_letter_highlights` lets you allow one-letter highlights. Just make the filter function return `true`.
* New filter: `relevanssi_block_one_letter_searches` by default blocks one-letter searches. If you want to enable them, add a filter function that always returns `false`.
* Fixed an undefined variable notice.

= 3.5.11 =
* Synonym indexing failed if synonyms contained a forward slash.
* Highlighting HTML tags has been improved further.
* New filter: `relevanssi_tag_before_tokenize` allows you to access tag content before indexing.
* Relevanssi now actively blocks one-letter search terms, as they are generally pointless and can cause "out of memory" issues. One-letter search terms are no longer highlighted, either. These are usually caused by cases like "word's" being interpreted as "word s".
* New filter: `relevanssi_disable_shortcodes_excerpt` lets you add more shortcodes to be disabled before excerpts are built.

= 3.5.10 =
* Some users got a fatal parse error. That shouldn't happen anymore.
* FacetWP users ran into trouble, as `relevanssi_do_query()` started to explicitly expect a WP_Query object in version 1.15.0. That expectation is removed; it's still highly recommended for future compatibility that you use WP_Query objects.
* Small bug fix: `get_current_screen()` is now only used when it's available to avoid occasional fatal errors.
* Error messages from `DOING_AJAX` being undefined should be removed.

= 3.5.9.1 =
* WP.org plugin repo didn't like 3.5.9 for some reason, hoping to have better luck with this.

= 3.5.9 =
* Improved the way highlighting handles HTML tags, especially when highlighting on post pages.
* The throttle limit setting was removed from the settings page for causing trouble. If you need to change it, update `relevanssi_throttle_limit` option directly.
* Relevanssi didn't support tax_queries with `field` set to `name`. That works now.
* Much faster way of showing the 25 most common words in the index. If you've disabled this feature because it was so slow, try enabling it - you might be surprised!

= 3.5.8 =
* Did you mean function had a XSS vulnerability, which is now removed.
* Minimum word length wasn't applied to titles in indexing. It is now fixed. If you think this is a problem, rebuild the index.
* TablePress compatibility has been improved.
* Meta query handling has been improved, thanks to Maxime Culea.
* Improved WP_Query parameter support: setting query variable `sentence` to 1 forces phrase search.
* Improved ACF compatibility.

= 3.5.7.1 =
* Small fix for a bug that broke the settings page.

= 3.5.7 =
* An improved version of the sorting function will not throw notices when Intuitive Custom Post Order plugin is used.
* New filter: `relevanssi_missing_sort_key` can be used to adjust the result sorting when using keys that are not present in all posts (eg. menu_order).
* Czech translation and stopwords, thanks to Michael Kucera.
* Relevanssi broke the WP admin menu search when admin searches were enabled.
* Relevanssi broke the admin page search under WP 4.7. Relevanssi is now disabled in admin page searches.
* The way accented characters are handled in highlighting is improved. A new filter, `relevanssi_accents_replacement_arrays`, can be used to adjust the accent replacement.

= 3.5.6.1 =
* Fix for a fatal bug in 3.5.6.

= 3.5.6 =
* Relevanssi admin page had a vulnerability that allowed SQL injection attacks. That is now fixed.
* Relevanssi didn't like to highlight search terms that are followed by a ?, an ! or an apostrophe.
* New filter: `relevanssi_ok_to_log` lets you control whether search queries are logged or not.

= 3.5.5 =
* 500 errors caused by arrays in custom fields should be gone now.
* Improvements to the ACF "select" field support.
* Relevanssi will not break when frontend plugins insert posts.
* `relevanssi_match` filter has a new parameter, which contains the search term.
* Polylang support has been improved.
* WPML and Polylang filters work when "fields" is set to "ids".
* New filter: `relevanssi_log_get_user` gets passed the user object before Relevanssi decides if the query should be logged or not.

= 3.5.4 =
* Relevanssi had a bug that lead to inflated relevancy scores for posts.
* Relevanssi can now index the human-readable labels of ACF "select" fields. (Thanks to Raphaël Droz.)
* New filter: `relevanssi_30days` can be used to adjust the 30 day logs to a different number of days.
* Adding stopwords that contain apostrophes didn't work.
* Ensured PHP7 and WP 4.6 compatibility.
* Fixed a small glitch that could happen if a highlighted term is next to a starting square bracket.

= 3.5.3 =
* New filter `relevanssi_user_searches_limit` to adjust the number of user searches shown in the logs.
* Old data check is only done on Relevanssi settings page, not on all admin pages. That should improve admin performance.
* Fixed a fatal error when searching includes private posts.
* New filter: `relevanssi_remote_addr` can be used to modify the IP address logged to Relevanssi logs.
* Blocked CFDB and WooCommerce shortcodes that are causing problems with Relevanssi.

= 3.5.2 =
* Added correct support for `term_taxonomy_id` in the `fields` parameter in tax_queries.

= 3.5.1 =
* Fixed an error in the Did you mean function.
* Fixed an error if the search term was not found in content.
* Fixed an error when building excerpts from posts shorter than the excerpt length.
* Blocked the `[starpro]` shortcode that was causing problems with Relevanssi.
* New filter: `relevanssi_remove_stopwords_in_titles` allows you to include stopwords in titles.
* Added support for `term_tax_id` in the `fields` parameter in tax_queries.
* Excerpt-building failed if multibyte string operations were missing. It should work now.

= 3.5 =
* Tokenizer was using `strlen()` and not `mb_strlen()`, so word lengths were not calculated properly. If your site uses non-ASCII alphabet, rebuilding the index is a good idea.
* Small improvement to WPML multilanguage filtering.
* `relevanssi_the_title()` got a new parameter: if you don't want to echo the title, you can use it like `relevanssi_the_title(false)` to make it return the title.
* Relevanssi had `the_title` filter hook calls that were missing the second parameter; that's now fixed.
* The excerpt-building algorithm is completely rewritten based on work by Ben Boyter (http://www.boyter.org/).
* The `[watupro]` shortcode didn't work with Relevanssi, so Relevanssi will now bypass it.
* The plugin i18n features have been improved slightly.
* New filter: `relevanssi_didyoumean_suggestion` lets you modify the Did you mean? suggestion before it's displayed.
* `relevanssi_didyoumean()` has a new parameter: you can now choose whether the result is echoed out (the default value) or just returned.
* In the search results breakdown, you can now use %categories% and %taxonomies% to show the number of matches in categories and taxonomies other than tags and cats, respectively.
* Relevanssi supports `fields` parameter (both `ids` and `id=>parent`) to return only post IDs or post IDs and post parents.

= 3.4.2 =
* Empty lines on synonym settings caused problems. Fixed that.
* In WordPress 4.2 installations, emoji in will be handled better. Emoji in posts may cause problems with WordPress versions below 4.2, so please update!

= 3.4.1 =
* Removed a notice about an undefined variable.

= 3.4 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_valid_admin_status` can be used to adjust post statuses that Relevanssi will handle.
* If Relevanssi creates an empty excerpt for a post and there's a user-set excerpt for the post, that excerpt is used.
* No ellipsis is added to the post excerpt, if the post excerpt shows the whole post.
* The `relevanssi_post_title_before_tokenize` filter now has a second parameter that contains the post object.
* New filter: `relevanssi_display_common_words` can be used to disable the "25 most common words" listing on the settings page, if it's too heavy to load.
* Relevanssi was sanitizing taxonomy titles too aggressively. That is now toned down a bit.
* Relevanssi now supports `post_parent`, `post_parent__in` and `post_parent__not_in`, though you have to set them in `relevanssi_modify_wp_query` filter for them to work.
* Meta query support should now be perfect; there were some limitations with complicated meta queries before.

= 3.3.8 =
* Fixed a bug that caused the results to change depending of the order of words in a multi-word search query.
* Added `product_categories` and `recent_products` from WooCommerce to the list of blocked shortcodes.
* There are improvements in excerpt-building and highlighting, especially when fuzzy search is enabled.
* Fixed a possible (if quite unlikely) XSS vulnerability.
* Improved search performance (thanks to MikeNGarrett).
* Sometimes highlights in documents make the document content disappear. I don't know why, but I've added a fix that should make the content visible (without the highlights) if a problem appears.

= 3.3.7.1 =
* Fixed bbPress compatibility.

= 3.3.7 =
* Fixed bbPress compatibility.

= 3.3.6 =
* Relevanssi handles taxonomy terms in search better. The change requires a reindexing.
* Fix in indexing: Relevanssi will now bypass the global $post when indexing. This should help with problems with the Cookie Law Info plugin, for example.
* Tax query relation setting didn't work properly. It is now fixed.
* Word-based excerpt building sometimes created too short excerpts. That is now fixed.
* Synonyms are now highlighted.
* Phrase matching had issues where searching for a too common phrase crashed the search. That has been fixed.
* LIKE operator didn't work properly in meta_queries.
* Problems with Avatar Upload plugin are fixed.
* Offset errors with mb_stripos() shouldn't happen anymore.
* A small problem in taxonomy search MySQL fixed, also a small problem with AND operator in tax_queries.
* New filter: `relevanssi_post_to_index` lets you access the post object before the post is indexed.
* New filter: `relevanssi_orderby` lets you modify the $orderby value before Relevanssi sorts posts.

* Fixed a bug causing duplicate search results in WPML searches.
* Increased plugin safety against hackers.
* There was a bug in `relevanssi_comment_content_to_index` filter.
* Some people had problems with the log entry timestamps. Fixed that.
* New filter: `relevanssi_prevent_default_request` gives you more control over where Relevanssi prevents the default query from running.
* New filter: `relevanssi_private_cap` lets you set the correct capability for finding private posts in custom post types.
* The option to exclude categories and tags from search only worked for categories, not tags. Tags have been separated to a different option.

= 3.3.4 =
* Couple of bug fixes.

= 3.3.3 =
* OR fallback had problems.
* Indexing sub pages didn't work.
* Relevanssi now automatically treats 'ß' as 'ss'. If your site has 'ß' in text, reindexing the database is a good idea.
* Query variable `post_status` is now supported.

= 3.3.2 =
* Fixed a warning on search results page.

= 3.3.1 =
* Fixed bugs related to the removal of the cache feature.

= 3.3 =
* Improvements to excerpts: excerpts with phrases work much better now, and the excerpt creation logic has been improved: the excerpts are now better. The process takes a bit more time, though.
* Allowing HTML tags in excerpts could lead to those tags being left open. Relevanssi will now try to close open HTML tags in excerpts.
* Allowed tags were not controlled in comments. They are now.
* Highlighting in documents didn't always work; it should be more reliable now.
* Non-integer values are removed from `post__in` and `post__not_in` before processing them.
* Query variables `p` and `page_id` are now supported.
* Relevanssi now understands `date_query` variables as well.

* New functions: `relevanssi_the_title()` and `relevanssi_get_the_title()` can be used to display highlighted titles in search results.
* The old title highlighting method has been disabled, because it caused highlights in wrong places. Now the highlighted title is stored in $post->highlighted_post_title, take it from there or use the Relevanssi title functions to display it.
* Polylang and WPML support was adjusted to perform better in edge cases.
* Indexing is faster, thanks to some improved code from Tom Novelli.
* MySQL injection attack vulnerability removed.
* The cache feature is now removed. Relevanssi should automatically drop the cache tables.
* New filter: `relevanssi_indexing_data` lets you modify the data before it's indexed.

= 3.2 =
* Fixed a bug in the TablePress support.
* Titles are put through the_title filter before indexing.
* New filter: `relevanssi_join` can be used to join tables in the Relevanssi search MySQL queries. Thanks to Ninos Ego.
* New filter: `relevanssi_post_content` can be used to modify post content before any Relevanssi processing.
* New filter: `relevanssi_post_content_before_tokenize` can be used to modify post content just before it's tokenized.
* New filter: `relevanssi_indexing_values` can be used to modify what Relevanssi stores in the index.
* New filter: `relevanssi_default_meta_query_relation` can be used to change the default meta query relation (default value is "AND").

* Phrases are now matched to excerpts.
* Number of queries Relevanssi generates is much, much lower.
* New filter: `relevanssi_didyoumean_url` lets you modify the URL generated by the did you mean feature.
* Better set of Russian stopwords.

= 3.1.9 =
* Fix to make Relevanssi compatible with WordPress 3.7.

* Relevanssi disables responsive-flipbook shortcode in indexing; it was causing problems.
* Fixed a problem with an author dropdown with no author selected.

= 3.1.8 =
* Category restriction and exclusion and couple of other category-related settings didn't work properly.
* Support for Polylang broke the support for WPML. That is now fixed.
* One deprecated `$wpdb->escape()` was still left; it's gone now.
* Shortcode `layerslider` was causing problems with Relevanssi; Relevanssi now disables it before building excerpts.
* Relevanssi won't break BBPress search anymore.
* If Relevanssi Premium is installed, deleting Relevanssi will not remove the databases and the options.

= 3.1.7 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_comment_content_to_index` lets you modify comment content before it's indexed by Relevanssi (to index comment meta, for example).
* Facetious support: if post_type is set to -1, Relevanssi will not hang up on it.
* Numerical search terms work better now.
* Excerpt-building had issues, which are now fixed.
* Punctuation removal now replaces &nbsp; with a space.
* "starrater" short code from GD Star Rating is now disabled in indexing.

* Relevanssi doesn't apply `get_the_excerpt` filters to excerpts it builds any more.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt` lets you modify the excerpts Relevanssi creates.
* Relevanssi now suspends WP post cache while indexing, making indexing a lot more efficient. Thanks to Julien Mession for this one.
* Deprecated function errors in 3.6 removed.
* When search included user profiles or taxonomy terms, Relevanssi would generate lots of MySQL errors. Not anymore.
* New filter: `relevanssi_valid_status` lets you modify the post statuses Relevanssi indexes.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_taxonomies_args` lets you modify the arguments passed to get_terms() when indexing taxonomies (for example to set 'hide_empty' to false).
* Searching by taxonomy ID could confuse two taxonomies with the same term_id. The search is now checking the taxonomy as well to see it's correct.
* Basic support for Polylang plugin.
* Russian and Italian stopwords are now included, thanks to Flector and Valerio Vendrame.
* Small fix in the way user meta fields are handled.

= 3.1.6 =
* DEACTIVATE AND ACTIVATE THE PLUGIN AFTER YOU UPDATE.
* Fuzzy searches are now a lot more efficient; they were a huge resource hog before.
* Fixed a possible MySQL injection attack.
* Fixed MySQL errors from empty meta queries.
* Sort order (orderby and order variables) are now read from query variables instead of global variables.
* Relevanssi will not choke on bad values of orderby anymore.
* Limit searches is improved: when using AND search it is less likely to miss results.
* Phrase recognition read the whole post content (which it didn't need) from database, causing memory issues in some cases. Fixed that.
* Highlighting was broken, and should work much better now.

= 3.1.5 =
* OR fallback didn't actually fall back to OR, but instead got stuck in an endless loop of AND searches.
* Meta queries didn't work without a key; now they work with just meta_value or meta_value_num.
* Meta queries had problems with meta_value being set to null.
* Relevanssi now supports category__and. By default this sets include_children to false.
* When querying by slug, the term taxonomy is also taken into consideration, fixing problems when same slug appears in different taxonomies.
* Author search didn't work.
* Fixed an error message caused by all-number synonyms starting with zero, like 02.
* Synonyms are now case-insensitive.
* New filter: `relevanssi_default_tax_query_relation` can be used to change the default tax query relation from OR to AND.
* Fixed undefined variable errors when doing an OR fallback.
* New filter: `relevanssi_bots_to_not_log` makes it possible to block bots from logs. The format matches what other plugins, ie. WP-Useronline, use for bot blocking, so you can share block lists.
* New filter: `relevanssi_admin_search_ok` gives you more control when Relevanssi overrides the default WP search in admin, useful for fixing P2P_Box AJAX search.
* Ordering search results by title or date in admin search works now.
* Modified the way the highlights work; now highlighting words with apostrophes should produce more meaningful results.
* Highlighting should not highlight anything between & and ; or in <style> or <script> tags, thus solving some of the problems related to highlights. Reports of how well this works are welcome.
* On-post highlighting now only highlights content in the loop, so menu texts and other off-the-loop stuff should not get highlights anymore.
* New action hook: `relevanssi_pre_indexing_query` can be used to "SET OPTION SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1" if needed.
* Major indexing problems caused by shortcodes changing the post ID during the indexing of posts are now fixed.
* Relevanssi was being called twice when a post was saved, on `save_post` and `wp_insert_post`. I removed the hook on `save_post`.
* Unsuccessful searches are now ordered by count, like the successful queries are.

= 3.1.4 =
* Choosing which taxonomies to index is now done with an easy-to-use checkbox list.
* Support for WP Table Reloaded and TablePress. Tables created with these plugins will now be expanded and the content indexed by Relevanssi.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_comments_exclude` can be used to exclude comments from indexing. The filter gets the post ID as a parameter, so you can prevent comments of particular posts being indexed, yet index those posts.
* Relevanssi now adds spaces between tags when creating excerpts to make neater excerpts from tables and other similar situations.
* Relevanssi now indexes unattached attachments, if you choose to index attachments.
* Fixed the problems with Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven themes better.
* $match->tag now contains the number of tag hits.
* Relevanssi now adds relevance score to posts before passing them to relevanssi_hits_filter. You can find it in $post->relevance_score.
* Tags in breakdowns always showed 0, even though tags were indexed and searched correctly. That's now fixed.

= 3.1.3 =
* AND search did not work in all cases.
* Posts couldn't be found by category name. Fixed that.

= 3.1.2 =
* Exclude category option was broken. Fixed that.
* Searching for a non-existing category ID caused an error. Fixed that.
* Occasional blank screens of death occurred when multibyte string operations weren't installed. That should not happen anymore.
* Fallback to OR search was a bit broken.

= 3.1.1 =
* Small fix to prevent database errors.
* Small fix to prevent disappearing excerpts.

= 3.1 =
* Fixed the uninstalling instructions.
* Fixes a problem with Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven themes that caused doubled "Continue Reading" links.
* Fixed a notice about undefined variable on plugin update pages.
* Small bug fixes on search to remove warning notices.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` can be used to modify the list of custom fields to index.
* Deleting menus caused a warning. That is now fixed.
* Relevanssi has an option to disable IP logging (which is actually illegal in some countries). Thanks to Stefan Eufinger.
* Searching in subcategories worked sometimes, but not always. Thanks to Faebu.
* The "Limit searches" option didn't work too well in the case of strong weightings, as it didn't take note of any weights. Now it works better.
* Added a note about disabling custom excerpts when they are not needed - they can slow down the search quite a bit.
* New filter: `relevanssi_options_capability` can be used to modify the capability required to see the options page (default is `manage_options`).
* Fixed the way IDF is calculated to account some extreme cases with small databases.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` gives added control over which custom fields are indexed.
* Fixed filter: `relevanssi_pre_excerpt_content` wasn't working properly.
* Relevanssi now supports tax_query, for most part. You can query multiple taxonomies, use relation AND and OR, use operators AND, IN and NOT IN and choose include_children (which defaults to true). Old `taxonomy` and `term` still work, but I recommend using tax_query for the level of control it offers.
* Relevanssi now works better with category restrictions. The extra `cats` query variable is no longer necessary, Relevanssi can now read multiple categories from `cat`. You can also use `category__and`, `category__in` and `category__not_in`.
* Same goes with tags: `tags` is now longer necessary. Relevanssi has full support for `tag`, `tag_id`, `tag__and`, `tag__in`, `tag__not_in`, `tag_slug__and`, `tag_slug__in` and `tag_slug__not_in`. For `tag`, both `term1+term2` and `term1,term2` is supported.
* Relevanssi now supports `author_name` and negative values for `author`.
* Relevanssi now supports `offset` query variable.
* Relevanssi now supports meta_query. You can use all comparisons (also EXISTS and NOT EXISTS, even if you don't have WP 3.5). You can also use the older `meta_key` and `meta_value` query variables, including all the comparisons. I have not tested all possible meta_query constructions, so bug reports of things that don't work as expected are welcome.
* New index on the database makes some database operations faster.
* Removed a bug that prevents one-character words from being indexed in titles, despite the minimum word length setting.
* Removed a warning when searching for nothing.
* Fixes a warning about $wpdb->prepare() caused by a change in WordPress 3.5.

* New shortcode: use shortcode `noindex` to wrap parts of posts you want to keep from the index.
* And a bunch of other changes.

= 2.1.6 =

= 1.7.3 =

= 1.7.2 =
* Small bug fix: public posts that are changed to private are now removed from index (password protected posts remain in index).
* An Italian translation is now included (thanks to Alessandro Fiorotto).

= 1.7.1 =
