Relevanssi replaces the default search with a partial-match search that sorts results by relevance. It also indexes comments and shortcode content.

== Description ==

Relevanssi replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine, with lots of features and configurable options. You'll get better results, better presentation of results - your users will thank you.

This is the free version of Relevanssi. There's also Relevanssi Premium, which has added features. For more information about Premium, see [Relevanssi.com](https://www.relevanssi.com/).

Do note that using Relevanssi may require large amounts (hundreds of megabytes) of database space. If your hosting setup has a limited amount of space for database tables, using Relevanssi may cause problems. In those cases use of Relevanssi cannot be recommended.

1. Go to the plugin settings page and build the index following the instructions there.
1. That's it!

Relevanssi uses the standard search form and doesn't usually need any changes in the search results template.

If the search does not bring any results, your theme probably has a query_posts() call in the search results template. That throws Relevanssi off. For more information, see [The most important Relevanssi debugging trick](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/query_posts/).

= Uninstalling =
To uninstall the plugin remove the plugin using the normal WordPress plugin management tools (from the Plugins page, first Deactivate, then Delete). If you remove the plugin files manually, the database tables and options will remain.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Knowledge Base =
You can find solutions and answers at the [Relevanssi Knowledge Base](https://www.relevanssi.com/category/knowledge-base/).

= Contextual help =
Answers to many common problems can be found from the contextual menu. Just click "Help" in the top right corner of your WordPress admin dashboard on the Relevanssi settings page.

= Relevanssi doesn't work =
If you the results don't change after installing and activating Relevanssi, the most likely reason is that you have a call to `query_posts()` on your search results template. This confuses Relevanssi. Try removing the `query_posts()` call and see what happens.

= Searching for words with ampersands or hyphens doesn't work =
Please read [Words with punctuation can't be found](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/). This is a Relevanssi feature, but you can fix it from Relevanssi indexing settings.

= Where are the user search logs? =
See the top of the admin menu. There's 'User searches'.

= Displaying the relevance score =
Relevanssi stores the relevance score it uses to sort results in the $post variable. Just add something like

`echo $post->relevance_score`

to your search results template inside a PHP code block to display the relevance score.

= Did you mean? suggestions =
Relevanssi offers Google-style "Did you mean?" suggestions. See ["Did you mean" suggestions](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/did-you-mean-suggestions/) in the Knowledge Base for more details.

= What is tf * idf weighing? =

It's the basic weighing scheme used in information retrieval. Tf stands for *term frequency* while idf is *inverted document frequency*. Term frequency is simply the number of times the term appears in a document, while document frequency is the number of documents in the database where the term appears.

Thus, the weight of the word for a document increases the more often it appears in the document and the less often it appears in other documents.

= What are stop words? =

Each document database is full of useless words. All the little words that appear in just about every document are completely useless for information retrieval purposes. Basically, their inverted document frequency is really low, so they never have much power in matching. Also, removing those words helps to make the index smaller and searching faster.

== Thanks ==
* Cristian Damm for tag indexing, comment indexing, post/page exclusion and general helpfulness.
* Marcus Dalgren for UTF-8 fixing.
* Warren Tape for 2.5.5 fixes.
* Mohib Ebrahim for relentless bug hunting.
* John Calahan for extensive 4.0 beta testing.

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.7 =
* Recent post bonus is now applied to searches.
* Exact term setting can now be disabled.
* Users of Members plugin would have drafts appear in search results. This is now fixed.

= 4.0.6 =
* Indexing bugs squashed.
* Missing tag and category weight settings returned.
* Fusion builder shortcodes are removed from excerpts.
* MemberPress post control was backwards.
* User searches page reset buttons fixed.
* WPML language filter fix.

= 4.0.5 =
* Relevanssi code has been reviewed and modified to follow WordPress coding standards. As a result, there have been minor improvements all around the code to make things more robust and secure.
* Custom field detail is no longer serialized. It's now JSON. If you use custom field detail, rebuild the index and change your code to use json_decode() instead of unserialize().
* `relevanssi_the_tags()` and `relevanssi_get_the_tags()` now have different set of parameters, more in line with `the_tags()` and `get_the_tags()`.
* Taxonomy indexing settings were emptied out if you saved another options tab. That is now fixed.
* Improvements to WPML support; WPML is now less likely to be confused in multisite searches.
* Updated filter: `relevanssi_search_ok` now gets the WP_Query object as a parameter, which is helpful if you're not using the global $wp_query.
* ACF Flexible Content field indexing didn't work properly, possibly due to a change in ACF. That should now work better.

* Small bug fixes.
